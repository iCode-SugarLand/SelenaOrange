  <p>Hatsune Miku was the first Vocaloid developed by Crypton Future Media after they handled the release of the Yamaha vocal Meiko and Kaito. Miku was intended to be the first of a series of Vocaloids called the "Character Vocal Series" (abbreviated "CV Series"), which included Kagamine Rin/Len and Megurine Luka.Hatsune Miku was one of the first character personas developed by Crypton Future Media for their Vocaloid software. She debuted in 2007. Vocaloid is an advanced voice synthesizer software.If you're into the Vocaloid fandom, you may already know that Crypton Future Media (the company that produces Hatsune Miku, Kagamine Rin and Len, Megurine Luka, Kaito and Meiko) has announced that their singers aren't getting more updates on Vocaloid.It's to the point that FNF character designer PhantomArcade loves the idea of them being siblings, he has an official sketch of Boyfriend calling her sis. ninjamuffin99 has confirmed that Miku is semi-canonically Boyfriend's sister.On October 17th 2007, less than 2 months after her software release, Miku's online popularity had begun to explode on an extremely large scale. The large number of people searching “Hatsune Miku” or “初音ミク” caused Google and Yahoo's servers to automatically block her name due to suspected spam or search abuse.</p>
